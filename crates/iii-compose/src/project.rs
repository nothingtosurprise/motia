//! One project: a compose file, the children it started, and the state that
//! outlives them.
//!
//! A project owns everything scoped to one `worker-compose.yaml` — its
//! namespace, its supervision, its durable record. What it does not own is the
//! engine connection: one daemon serves many projects over a single socket, so
//! the client is shared and every project addresses its own namespace through
//! it.
//!
//! It owns three things that must not drift apart — the processes it started,
//! the durable record of them, and what the engine believes. Every mutation
//! goes through [`Project`] so the state file is written on the same path that
//! changed the processes.
