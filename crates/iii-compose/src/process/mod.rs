//! Child supervision.
//!
//! Two invariants drive this module:
//!
//! 1. **A child is a process group, not a process.** Workers spawn language
//!    runtimes, build tools and their own children; signalling only the direct
//!    child leaves grandchildren holding ports and engine connections.
//! 2. **A PID is never signalled unless its identity is verified.** PIDs are
//!    recycled. After a daemon restart the recorded PID may belong to an
//!    unrelated process, so a start-time fingerprint is compared first and a
//!    mismatch reports for manual cleanup instead of signalling.
