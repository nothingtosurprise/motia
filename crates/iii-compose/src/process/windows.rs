//! Windows supervision: one Job Object per child, teardown by job.
//!
//! A Job Object is the windows answer to a process group: terminating the job
//! terminates the worker and everything it spawned. The child also gets its own
//! console process group, so a graceful `CTRL_BREAK` can be delivered before the
//! job is terminated outright.
//!
//! Jobs deliberately do not use `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`: workers
//! survive a daemon crash and are re-adopted on restart (see [`crate::state`]).
//! The managed engine uses a separate stdin lifeline instead.
