name: iii-state-management
description: >-
  Creates scoped key-value stores, reads and writes state entries, lists keys,
  and performs partial updates across functions. Use when persisting data between
  invocations, managing user sessions, caching computed values, storing feature
  flags, sharing state between workers, or building a KV data layer as an
  alternative to Redis or DynamoDB.

# State Management

Comparable to: Redis, DynamoDB, Memcached

## Key Concepts

Use the concepts below when they fit the task. Not every state operation needs all of them.

- State is a **scoped key-value store** accessed via built-in trigger functions
- **state::set** writes a value; **state::get** reads it (returns `null` for missing keys)
- **state::list** retrieves all keys in a scope; **state::delete** removes a key
- **state::update** performs a **partial merge** using an `ops` array for fine-grained changes
- Payloads use `scope`, `key`, and `value` to address state entries
- State is shared across all functions — use meaningful scope names to avoid collisions

## Architecture

    Function
      → trigger('state::set', { scope, key, value })
      → trigger('state::get', { scope, key })
      → trigger('state::update', { scope, key, ops })
      → trigger('state::delete', { scope, key })
      → trigger('state::list', { scope })
        → StateModule → KvStore / Redis adapter

## iii Primitives Used

| Primitive                                                     | Purpose                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `trigger({ function_id: 'state::set', payload })`             | Write a value to state              |
| `trigger({ function_id: 'state::get', payload })`             | Read a value from state             |
| `trigger({ function_id: 'state::list', payload })`            | List all keys in a scope            |
| `trigger({ function_id: 'state::delete', payload })`          | Remove a key from state             |
| `trigger({ function_id: 'state::update', payload: { ops } })` | Partial merge with operations array |

## Reference Implementation

See [../references/state-management.js](../references/state-management.js) for the full working example — functions that read, write, update, and delete state entries across a shared scope.

Also available in **Python**: [../references/state-management.py](../references/state-management.py)

Also available in **Rust**: [../references/state-management.rs](../references/state-management.rs)

## Common Patterns

Code using this pattern commonly includes, when relevant:

- `registerWorker(url, { workerName })` — worker initialization
- `trigger({ function_id: 'state::set', payload: { scope, key, value } })` — write state
- `trigger({ function_id: 'state::get', payload: { scope, key } })` — read state (returns `null` if missing)
- `trigger({ function_id: 'state::update', payload: { scope, key, ops } })` — partial merge
- `trigger({ function_id: 'state::list', payload: { scope } })` — enumerate keys
- `trigger({ function_id: 'state::delete', payload: { scope, key } })` — remove entry
- `const logger = new Logger()` — structured logging

## Adapting This Pattern

Use the adaptations below when they apply to the task.

- Name scopes after your domain (e.g. `user-sessions`, `order-data`, `config`)
- Use `state::get` with a `null` check to handle missing keys gracefully
- Use `state::update` with `ops` for partial updates instead of read-modify-write cycles
- Combine with `iii-queue-processing` to persist results after async job completion

## Engine Configuration

StateModule must be enabled in iii-config.yaml with a KvStore adapter (file-based or Redis). See [../references/iii-config.yaml](../references/iii-config.yaml) for the full annotated config reference.

## Pattern Boundaries

- If the task needs reactive side effects when state changes, prefer `iii-state-reactions`.
- If the task needs real-time client push when data updates, prefer `iii-realtime-streams`.
- Stay with `iii-state-management` when the primary need is reading and writing persistent key-value data.

## When to Use

- Use this skill when the task is primarily about `iii-state-management` in the iii engine.
- Triggers when the request directly asks for this pattern or an equivalent implementation.

## Boundaries

- Never use this skill as a generic fallback for unrelated tasks.
- You must not apply this skill when a more specific iii skill is a better fit.
- Always verify environment and safety constraints before applying examples from this skill.
