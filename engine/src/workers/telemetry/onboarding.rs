//! The onboarding tour reports its own progress.
//!
//! The `onboarding` worker publishes one message per closed tour step on the
//! `onboarding:steps:complete` topic. The engine subscribes to that topic
//! and reports each message as an `onboarding_step` product event, with the
//! payload the worker sent.
//!
//! The topic is a durable queue subscription, not fire-and-forget pub/sub: a
//! step closes once, and the message waits in the queue and is retried until
//! this handler takes it, rather than being dropped when nothing is listening
//! at that instant.
//!
//! One event per step, counted in memory only: the same step reported twice
//! (a redelivery, a reload, a second report from the agent) reports once,
//! while a restarted engine lets every step report again. Progress belongs to
//! the tour's own state, and an engine that persisted a shadow copy of it
//! would answer to nobody when the two disagreed.
//!
//! The `durable:subscriber` trigger type belongs to the `queue` worker. A
//! binding registered before its provider connects is parked and replayed
//! when the provider arrives (see `TriggerRegistry::register_trigger`), so
//! this registration is unconditional: a project without the tour, or without
//! `queue`, simply never fires it.
