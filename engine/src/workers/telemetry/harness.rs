//! The harness reports its own session usage.
//!
//! The `harness` worker publishes one message per reported moment on the
//! `harness:usage` topic (see the worker's `usage_report` module). The engine
//! subscribes to that topic and reports each message as one product event:
//! `harness_session_progress` at root turn 1, 2, 5, 10, 25 and 50, cumulative
//! so the last report supersedes the ones before it, and
//! `harness_turn_failed` once per session per outcome.
//!
//! The event name arrives in the message and is checked against the two names
//! above, so a stray publish on the topic cannot mint product events of its
//! own naming. Everything else in the message becomes the event properties.
//!
//! The topic is a durable queue subscription, not fire-and-forget pub/sub: a
//! turn ends once, and the message waits in the queue and is retried until
//! this handler takes it, rather than being dropped when nothing is listening
//! at that instant.
//!
//! The worker decides WHAT is worth reporting and reports each thing once,
//! durably. The `dedupe_key` it stamps on every message is the second line of
//! defence, counted in memory only: a redelivery inside one engine run
//! reports once, while a restarted engine may report a message again. Like
//! the tour's steps, progress belongs to the worker that owns it, and an
//! engine keeping a shadow copy would answer to nobody when the two
//! disagreed.
