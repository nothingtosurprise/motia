              the sdk spawns each trigger callback on its own task. two rapid re-registrations of one path can both
              observe the same old id, both unregister it, and whichever fetch finishes last wins — possibly the older
              build, plus a stale engine row.

              all script/style events — including the engine&apos;s unregister echo — drain through a single mpsc queue
              in arrival order. the echo lands after the commit it echoes and hits the unknown-id no-op branch.

              holding the section across engine::unregister_trigger cannot deadlock — the engine only awaits enqueueing
