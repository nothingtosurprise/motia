        worker_description: One-line, human/LLM-readable summary of what this
            worker does. Surfaces in ``engine::workers::list`` / ``engine::workers::info``.
        namespace: Namespace this worker belongs to. Falls back to the
            ``III_NAMESPACE`` env var; when neither is set the engine applies
            ``default``. It scopes more than the registration: the worker and
            its functions register here, and everything the worker does
            afterwards follows it -- ``trigger`` resolves its target here and
            ``register_trigger`` binds here, unless the call names another
            namespace.
        enable_metrics_reporting: Enable worker metrics via OpenTelemetry. Default ``True``.
        invocation_timeout_ms: Default timeout for ``worker.trigger()`` invocations in milliseconds. Default ``30000``.
        reconnection_config: WebSocket reconnection behavior.
        otel: OpenTelemetry configuration. Enabled by default.
            Set ``{'enabled': False}`` or env ``OTEL_ENABLED=false`` to disable.
